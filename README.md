# RnD-DAO
A Specialized DAO for Research Team



What we are trying to build is specialized form of DAO, I called RnD-DAO, as in DAO for Research Team.   The general characteristics is this DAO (in addition to the normal properties of DAO, e.g., governance, voting, etc) will have a mechanism to store digital assets (think of actively Money Generating NFT), mechanism to share earnings from the digital asset, mechanism to convert work (like finishing a task, into a stake in the DAO ownership). I guess that's going to be the decent goal for the limited timeframe. 

As a prototype, I am aiming to make it into something like a 5-10 membered DAO, each member will have distict role (like funder, worker, admin, AI-Agents,etc.)

The goal is less about building from scratch but to integrate several great components that already out there for this purpose. For instance AragonOS is a great starting point for the general DAO, since all the basic functionalities are already available, the digital asset can be set to work/earn in platform such as Fetch's AgentVerse, or Ocean Data Marketplace, or in the Human case the TalenT Layer network, etc. 

I am not so familiar with the Celestia capability in storing big amount of complex data, if internal data storage is not available, the ideal solution stack is to integrate with IPFS/Filecoin/Arweave. 

If anyone interested to work together on the idea, feel free to reach out. Maybe we can then consider building a public repo for the BUIDL.
